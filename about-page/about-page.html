          A Trailer Flower is an Underdog who has never fit in, and came from
          shit, but chose to make a Garden out of their trash pile.

        <p id="about">
          Brooke moved to town to be an international super star and Jack moved
          to town to write hit songs. Back in 2020 during quarantine a
          serendipitous moment around a fire struck the girls. Brooke asked Jack
          for the millionth time, "hey sis want to be in a band with me?" Jack's
          response was a "F*** no." Brooke pressed again and encouraged Jack to
          pick a word. Jack chose 'Trailer' and Brooke replied with 'Flowers'.
          Sitting in their camo lawn chairs the girls laughed ready to write.

        <p id="about">
          Transparency in their writings and authenticity as individuals are
          some of the important staples to their country, modern, hippy, western
          sound. Their faith, and desire to love well is expressed in the
          bangers and the ballads found in their energetic live shows.
        </p>
        <p id="about">
          Their 'why', is cultivated by the lyrics, "we make good things out of
          shit." This phrase heard in their 'theme song' is the gospel and tool
          used to compliment the broken parts of their stories and celebrate the
          richness found in their lives today.
        </p>
        <p id="about">
          The girls are currently recording their songs and trying to quit their
          server jobs so they can make music full time for you.
        </p>
        <p id="about">
          The best way to partnet with them is to come out and shake your ass at
          one of their shows. So, put your boots on and let's get this party
          started!
